The goal is to do at least 1 challenge every single day. I'm starting out with easier ones so I can get in the habit of practicing excellent problem-solving techniques. Once I learn more about standard computer science concepts in data structures and algorithms, I will move toward doing more difficult challenges. This repo is strictly for showing employers and colleagues that I am practicing code challenges every day.
